      <p>Those who have tasted an authentic tiramisu once know all other alternatives pale beside it. In my first blog, I came across its history, not the recipe for my favorite dessert, Tiramisu. I will be publishing the stories, tips, and techniques of desserts along with the recipes to get to know the foods we love to eat better. Today's guest on this blog is Tiramisu!

      <br/><br/>Let's see what you will think when you learn about the history of Tiramisu. Let's find out together how delicious Tiramisu came about and how it came to this day.

      <br/><br/>Tiramisu, one of the most known and loved desserts of Italian cuisine, has various rumors about its popularity. Although it is still not crystal clear when and by whom it was first made, the most told story about it is as follows:

      <br/><br/>In the 17th century, the Duke of Tuscany decided to visit the city of Siena. At that time, dessert was considered a meaningful sign of wealth, which the nobles could eat. Hence, the confectioners in Siena immediately entered the race to prepare a special dessert to honor the duke. It is said that the duke, who is known to enjoy desserts like every noble, consumed sweets that act as an aphrodisiac for his sexual problems. Based on this information, the confectioners prepare a dessert for the duke, which is made with simple ingredients but is said to have a powerful aphrodisiac effect. The duke liked this dessert very much, and the recipe for it began to circulate and suddenly became famous. Thanks to the Duke of Tuscany, who took the recipe for this dessert, which was called "Zuppa del Duca," that is, "Duke's Soup" at that time, and went to Florence, the dessert started to be known more. This dessert, which became more and more famous among the English intellectuals living in Florence at that time, soon became popular in England, and its name began to be called "tiramisu," which means "pull me up" in Italian.

      <br/><br/>However, many think that this story is just a legend. According to a recent story, a pastry chef immigrates to Milan and opens a restaurant in Treviso. To make his name known, he decides to prepare a dessert based on the daily flavors of the region, and the chef begins experimenting with combining coffee, creamy mascarpone, egg, and lady fingers biscuits. At the end of his trials of about two years, he finally reaches the perfect taste he desires. He says he named it "tiramisu," which means "pull me up," inspired by the espresso he puts in it. After this special dessert he prepared attracted attention, famous chefs of that period came to visit his place; and started to prepare their versions of Tiramisu with minor changes.

      <br/><br/>Tiramisu is inevitably one of our favorite desserts, although we don't know which story is true. These stories and the meaning of the verb inspired me for the plating of my Tiramisu. An idea of tiramisu presentation can be like this; imagine serving your Tiramisu in portions in a plastic baking hoop and place it on a serving plate. It will have "pull me up" written on the plastic hoop, and when you pull it up, the sabayon sauce and cocoa will cover the entire cake. Thus, you will have to actually "pull it up" to start eating the Tiramisu, which will "pull you up" after you eat it.

      <br/><br/>Inspired by this, are you ready for my delicious tiramisu recipe that will take you to Italy with fresh lady finger cookies and delicious sabayon sauce? I am very excited to share a recipe very close to the taste you will eat in Italy with its detailed tricks and techniques you won't find anywhere else.
